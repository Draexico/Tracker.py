So I am fairly new to coding and I wanted to make a little fun project. I have been playing NieR Automata a lot and love that game. 
Basically, every time I get hit it is 1 point, death is 10. 
The keybinds...most of the time work fine. For some reason they stop at 10 and sometimes 100, after that it's fine. 
Only fix is if I alt tab back to it. So if anybody wants to help me improve the code I'd appreaciate it!
